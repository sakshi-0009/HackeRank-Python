# Question : Task - You are given a complex z. Your task is to convert it to polar coordinates.

Input Format - A single line containing the complex number z . Note: complex() function can be used in python to convert the input as a complex number.

Constraints - Given number is a valid complex number

Output Format - 
Output two lines:
The first line should contain the value of r.
The second line should contain the value of alpha .

# Answer : 

import cmath
print(*cmath.polar(complex(input())), sep='\n')
